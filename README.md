# Rent Comparisons in Singapore
This project is meant to perform a simple analysis between the rental prices listed in property guru and the actual rental prices transacted and published by the URA.
- The source of URA data comes from their own API - Only rentals from the last few months are included.
- The source of property guru data comes from their own website
- The analysis is performed at each condominium comparing average listing price for that property and the average rental transacted values for that property.
- The data extraction was performed on Dec 16 2022. This project only includes the data and the code for
the comparison but not the source code for the data extraction.
